/*  	GRBL AutoLeveller (https://github.com/henols/GrblAutoLeveller) is a stand-alone PC application written in Java which is designed
 *  	to measure precisely the height of the material to be milled / etched in several places,
 *  	then use the information gathered to make adjustments to the Z height
 *  	during the milling / etching process so that a more consistent and accurate result can be achieved.
